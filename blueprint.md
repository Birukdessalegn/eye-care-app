## Current Plan: Final Fix for Configuration Issues

**Goal:** Resolve the persistent `CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND` and `No AppCheckProvider installed` errors by correcting the Android package name and directory structure.

**Steps:**

1.  **Create New Directory Structure:** Create the new directory path `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/ocucare/app`.
2.  **Move MainActivity.kt:** Move the `MainActivity.kt` file from `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/myapp/` to the new directory.
3.  **Update MainActivity.kt:** Change the package declaration in `MainActivity.kt` to `package com.ocucare.app`.
4.  **Update AndroidManifest.xml:** Check and update the `AndroidManifest.xml` files to ensure they don't reference the old package name.
5.  **Delete Old Directory:** Remove the old, empty `com/example/myapp` directory.
6.  **Clean and Rerun:** Run `flutter clean` and then `flutter run` to apply the changes and verify the fix.
